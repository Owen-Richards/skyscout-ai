# SkyScout AI - Project Vision & Development Roadmap

## üéØ Mission Statement
SkyScout AI is a cutting-edge, AI-powered flight discovery platform that revolutionizes how users find, compare, and book flights. We leverage advanced machine learning, real-time data processing, and intuitive design to provide the smartest flight search experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Vision

### Frontend (Next.js 14 + TypeScript)
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **AI-Enhanced Search**: Intelligent flight search with predictive suggestions
- **Real-time Updates**: Live price tracking and availability notifications
- **Interactive Maps**: Visual flight route exploration with pricing overlays
- **Personalization**: AI-driven recommendations based on user preferences

### Backend Microservices
- **Flight Aggregation Service** (Node.js/NestJS): Real-time flight data collection
- **AI Prediction Engine** (Python/FastAPI): Price prediction & demand forecasting
- **Search & Indexing Service** (Rust): High-performance flight search engine
- **User & Booking Service** (Go): User management and booking workflows
- **Notification Service** (Node.js): Real-time alerts and communications

### Data & AI Layer
- **Flight Data Pipeline**: Real-time ingestion from multiple airline APIs
- **ML Models**: Price prediction, demand forecasting, route optimization
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for fast, relevant results
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking and business intelligence
