# SkyScout AI - Mobile Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for migrating SkyScout AI to Android and iOS platforms, leveraging our existing Next.js/React codebase.

## Migration Options Analysis

### 1. React Native (Recommended)

**Effort Level: Medium (6-8 months)**

**Pros:**

- 70-80% code reuse from existing React components
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Shared business logic and state management
- Strong ecosystem and community
- Hot reloading for faster development
- Cross-platform deployment

**Cons:**

- Some platform-specific code needed
- Performance limitations for heavy animations
- Bridge overhead for native modules

**Current Compatibility:**

- ✅ React components (most can be adapted)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces and types
- ✅ Business logic and utilities
- ✅ tRPC client (works with React Native)
- ❌ Next.js specific features (SSR, routing)
- ❌ Tailwind CSS (need React Native alternative)

### 2. Expo (Easiest Migration)

**Effort Level: Low-Medium (4-6 months)**

**Pros:**

- Fastest development cycle
- Over-the-air updates
- Easy deployment to app stores
- Built-in navigation and components
- Great developer experience
- Can eject to bare React Native if needed

**Cons:**

- Some limitations on native modules
- App size can be larger
- Less control over build process

### 3. Capacitor (Minimal Changes)

**Effort Level: Low (2-4 months)**

**Pros:**

- Minimal code changes required
- Web-based approach
- Can reuse existing Next.js app
- Fast development cycle
- Easy to maintain single codebase

**Cons:**

- Performance limitations
- Less native feel
- Limited access to native APIs
- App size and memory usage

### 4. Native Development (Separate Apps)

**Effort Level: High (12-18 months)**

**Pros:**

- Best performance
- Full access to platform APIs
- Native user experience
- Platform-specific optimizations

**Cons:**

- Complete rewrite required
- Separate codebases to maintain
- Higher development cost
- Longer time to market

## Recommended Approach: React Native with Expo

### Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)

1. **Project Setup**

   ```bash
   npx create-expo-app@latest SkyScoutMobile --template tabs
   cd SkyScoutMobile
   npx expo install expo-dev-client
   ```

2. **Dependencies Migration**

   ```bash
   # Core dependencies
   npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
   npm install @tanstack/react-query @trpc/client @trpc/react-query
   npm install zod react-hook-form

   # UI Library adaptation
   npm install react-native-paper # Alternative to our custom UI
   npm install react-native-vector-icons
   npm install react-native-maps

   # Performance
   npm install react-native-fast-image
   npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
   ```

3. **Shared Code Extraction**
   - Move types to shared package
   - Extract business logic to shared utilities
   - Create platform-agnostic API layer

### Phase 2: Core Features (Month 3-4)

1. **Navigation Structure**

   ```typescript
   // App structure
   - Authentication Flow
   - Main Tab Navigator
     - Flights
     - Hotels
     - Budget
     - Itinerary
     - Profile
   ```

2. **Component Migration Priority**
   - Authentication components (high reuse)
   - Search forms (adapt for mobile UX)
   - Deal cards (mobile-optimized layout)
   - Budget tracking (mobile-first design)

3. **State Management**
   - Keep existing tRPC setup
   - Add offline persistence with AsyncStorage
   - Implement optimistic updates

### Phase 3: Mobile-Specific Features (Month 5-6)

1. **Native Integrations**

   ```typescript
   // Location services
   expo install expo-location

   // Camera/photo uploads
   expo install expo-image-picker

   // Notifications
   expo install expo-notifications

   // Biometric authentication
   expo install expo-local-authentication
   ```

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement FlatList for large data sets
   - Add image optimization and caching
   - Optimize bundle size with Metro bundler

3. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Cache search results
   - Offline itinerary access
   - Sync when connection restored

## Code Reuse Strategy

### 1. Shared Business Logic (90% reuse)

```typescript
// Current structure that can be shared
libs/
├── shared/
│   ├── types/          # ✅ 100% reusable
│   ├── validators/     # ✅ 100% reusable
│   ├── utils/         # ✅ 95% reusable
│   └── constants/     # ✅ 100% reusable
├── trpc/              # ✅ 95% reusable (client side)
└── api-client/        # ✅ 100% reusable
```

### 2. Component Adaptation (60% reuse)

```typescript
// Adaptation strategy
Web Component -> Mobile Component
Button        -> TouchableOpacity + styling
Card          -> View with elevation/shadow
Form          -> React Native form components
Modal         -> React Native Modal
Navigation    -> React Navigation
```

### 3. New Mobile-Specific Code (40% new)

- Native navigation patterns
- Mobile-optimized layouts
- Touch gestures and interactions
- Platform-specific UI components
- Camera and location integrations

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Optimization

```javascript
// metro.config.js optimizations
module.exports = {
  transformer: {
    minifierConfig: {
      keep_fnames: true,
      mangle: {
        keep_fnames: true,
      },
    },
  },
  resolver: {
    alias: {
      '@': './src',
    },
  },
};
```

### Memory Management

- Use FlatList for large datasets
- Implement image lazy loading
- Clean up subscriptions and listeners
- Use React.memo for expensive components

## Current Codebase Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Ready for Mobile

- TypeScript architecture
- Component-based structure
- Shared types and interfaces
- API layer abstraction
- Business logic separation

### ⚠️ Needs Adaptation

- Tailwind CSS → React Native StyleSheet
- Next.js routing → React Navigation
- Server components → Client components
- Web-specific optimizations

### ❌ Requires Replacement

- Next.js SSR/SSG features
- Web-specific performance optimizations
- Browser APIs (localStorage, etc.)
- CSS-based animations
