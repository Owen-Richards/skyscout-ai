# SkyScout AI Architecture Improvement Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Priority: HIGH

#### 1.1 State Management Migration

- [ ] Install Zustand: `npm install zustand`
- [ ] Create flight search store pattern
- [ ] Migrate 1-2 complex components to use Zustand
- [ ] **Benefits**: Simpler state management, better performance

#### 1.2 Service Layer Implementation

- [ ] Create service container pattern
- [ ] Extract flight search logic to service layer
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for services
- [ ] **Benefits**: Better testability, separation of concerns

#### 1.3 Feature-Driven Structure (Start Small)

- [ ] Create `features/flight-search/` directory
- [ ] Move flight search components to feature boundary
- [ ] Create feature-specific hooks and services
- [ ] **Benefits**: Better code organization, team scalability

## Phase 2: Backend Enhancement (Weeks 5-8)

### Priority: HIGH

#### 2.1 Domain-Driven Design

- [ ] Restructure API to use domain boundaries
- [ ] Create flight search domain with entities/services
- [ ] Implement repository pattern
- [ ] **Benefits**: Clear business logic separation, easier maintenance

#### 2.2 Event-Driven Architecture

- [ ] Implement event bus with Redis
- [ ] Add domain events for flight searches
- [ ] Create event handlers for analytics/notifications
- [ ] **Benefits**: Loose coupling, better scalability

#### 2.3 Advanced API Layer

- [ ] Add GraphQL gateway (optional)
- [ ] Implement query optimization
- [ ] Add real-time subscriptions for price alerts
- [ ] **Benefits**: Flexible data fetching, real-time features

## Phase 3: Developer Experience (Weeks 9-12)

### Priority: MEDIUM

#### 3.1 Enhanced Development Tools

- [ ] Create comprehensive dev environment script
- [ ] Add service health monitoring
- [ ] Implement hot reload for all services
- [ ] **Benefits**: Faster development cycles, better debugging

#### 3.2 Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Set up comprehensive testing patterns
- [ ] Add integration tests for service layer
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing
- [ ] **Benefits**: Higher confidence in deployments, fewer bugs

#### 3.3 Performance Optimization

- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategies
- [ ] Add request/response compression
- [ ] Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- [ ] **Benefits**: Better user experience, lower costs

## Phase 4: Scalability (Weeks 13-16)

### Priority: MEDIUM

#### 4.1 Micro-Frontend Architecture (Optional)

- [ ] Extract flight search to separate micro-frontend
- [ ] Implement module federation
- [ ] Create shared component communication
- [ ] **Benefits**: Team independence, technology flexibility

#### 4.2 Advanced Monitoring

- [ ] Implement distributed tracing
- [ ] Add business metrics dashboards
- [ ] Create alerting system for key metrics
- [ ] **Benefits**: Better observability, proactive issue resolution

#### 4.3 Advanced Security

- [ ] Implement rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add API key management
- [ ] Create audit logging system
- [ ] **Benefits**: Better security posture, compliance

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience Metrics

- [ ] Build time: Reduce by 30%
- [ ] Hot reload time: Under 1 second
- [ ] Test execution: Under 30 seconds for unit tests
- [ ] Setup time for new developers: Under 30 minutes

### Performance Metrics

- [ ] API response time: Under 200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Frontend bundle size: Under 250KB for main bundle
- [ ] Database query time: Under 50ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Cache hit ratio: Above 80%

### Quality Metrics

- [ ] Test coverage: Above 90%
- [ ] TypeScript coverage: 100%
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance budget compliance: 100%

## Implementation Guidelines

### Quick Wins (Immediate Impact)

1. **Zustand Migration**: Start with flight search state
2. **Service Layer**: Extract one complex service
3. **Feature Structure**: Move flight search to feature folder

### Long-term Investments

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Biggest scalability improvement
2. **Micro-Frontends**: Best for team scaling
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Critical for production

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Gradual Migration**: Don't change everything at once
2. **Feature Flags**: Use for new architecture patterns
3. **Rollback Plans**: Keep old code until new is proven
4. **Team Training**: Ensure everyone understands new patterns

## Dependencies Installation

```bash
# Phase 1 Dependencies
npm install zustand immer
npm install @types/node
