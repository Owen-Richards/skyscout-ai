# AI Bot Daily Workflow Guide

## ðŸš€ How to Use AI Bots for Autonomous Development

### Morning Setup (Before Work)

1. **Check AI Task Queue**

   ```bash
   cat .github/AI_TASK_QUEUE.md
   ```

2. **Create New Development Tasks**

   ```bash
   # Create issue with AI development template
   gh issue create --title "[AI-DEV] Feature Name" --body "Description" --label "ai-development"
   ```

3. **Trigger AI Development**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Find the issue you created
   - Comment: `/ai-develop implement [specific task]`

### Available AI Triggers

| Command       | Purpose                      | Example                                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `/ai-develop` | Start autonomous development | `/ai-develop implement user authentication` |
| `/ai-review`  | Code review and improvements | `/ai-review optimize performance`           |
| `/ai-test`    | Generate comprehensive tests | `/ai-test add unit tests for search`        |
| `/ai-docs`    | Update documentation         | `/ai-docs api documentation`                |
| `/ai-fix`     | Bug fixing                   | `/ai-fix resolve search filter issue`       |

### Evening Review (After Work)

1. **Check GitHub Actions**

   ```bash
   gh workflow list
   gh run list --limit 10
   ```

2. **Review AI-Generated PRs**

   ```bash
   gh pr list --label "ai-generated"
   ```

3. **Merge Approved Changes**
   ```bash
   gh pr merge [PR-NUMBER] --squash
   ```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring AI Development

### Daily Checks

1. **Issues Dashboard**: https://github.com/Owen-Richards/skyscout-ai/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aai-development
2. **AI PRs**: https://github.com/Owen-Richards/skyscout-ai/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3Aai-generated
3. **Workflow Runs**: https://github.com/Owen-Richards/skyscout-ai/actions

### Quality Assurance

- All AI-generated code goes through automated testing
- Code review workflows ensure quality standards
- Breaking changes are flagged for manual review

## ðŸ”§ Quick Commands

```bash
# Start daily AI development
./scripts/activate-ai-bots.sh

# Check AI progress
gh issue list --label "ai-development"

# Review AI-generated code
gh pr list --label "ai-generated"

# Monitor workflow runs
gh run list --workflow "AI Code Review"
```

## ðŸŽª Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: The more detailed your issue description, the better the AI output
2. **Use Labels**: Tag issues with priority and feature labels
3. **Review Daily**: Check AI progress every evening to guide next steps
4. **Iterative Development**: Break large features into smaller AI-manageable tasks
5. **Quality Gates**: Let automated tests and reviews catch issues before merging

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Commands

If AI bots create issues:

```bash
# Stop all AI workflows
gh workflow disable "AI Code Review & Quality Check"
gh workflow disable "Automated Code Maintenance"

# Revert problematic changes
git revert [commit-hash]

# Re-enable after fixing
gh workflow enable "AI Code Review & Quality Check"
```

Your AI development infrastructure is now active and ready to build features while you're at work! ðŸŽ‰
